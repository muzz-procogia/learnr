## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code


## Code {auto-animate="true"}

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```r
# Fill in the spot we created for a plot
output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
  # Render a barplot
})
```

## Code {auto-animate="true"}

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```r
# Fill in the spot we created for a plot
output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
  # Render a barplot
  barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, 
          main=input$region,
          ylab="Number of Telephones",
          xlab="Year")
})
```

## Test

This code computes the answer to one plus one,
change it so it computes two plus two:

```{r addition, exercise=TRUE}
1 + 1
```
